Device repository for Meizu M2 Mini (CyanogenMod)
===========================

Getting Started
---------------

Initialize a repository with CyanogenMode:

    repo init -u git://github.com/divis1969/android.git -b meilan2

Optinally use a specific manifest (not a tip):

    repo init -u git://github.com/divis1969/android.git -b meilan2 -m meilan2-cm-12.1-v0.11.xml

Note: 6 more Cyanogen repositories were forked since v0.2, so if you will encounter an error while syncing on top
of exiting tree, use the suggestion from the error log (sync those repos with --force-sync) 

Build the code:

    source build/envsetup.sh
    breakfast meilan2
    make -j 4 bacon showcommands 2>&1 | tee build.log
